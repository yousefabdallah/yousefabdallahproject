                        <p><big>AI has been consistently one of the biggest tech trends over the past half decade, and as the marketing saturation for AI continues, the buzzwords can become overwhelming. 
                            However, within AI software, G2 Crowd has determined a few trends within the trend: embedded AI and machine learning as a service (MLaaS).
                            Embedded AI â€” Machine and deep learning functionality is becoming embedded in nearly all types of software, whether the user is aware of it or not. 
                            The use of embedded AI inside software like CRM, marketing automation, and analytics solutions is allowing users to streamline processes, automate certain tasks, and gain a competitive edge with predictive capabilities. 
                            Embedded AI will only pick up in the coming years in a similar fashion to the way cloud deployment and mobile capabilities have over the past decade or so. Eventually, it will be so commonplace that vendors will not need to highlight the fact that their product benefits from machine 
                            learning; it will just be assumed and expected.</big></p>
