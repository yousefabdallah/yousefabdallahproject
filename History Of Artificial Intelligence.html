<p><big>Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1955, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism,[13][14] followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an "AI winter"),[15][16] followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding.[14][17] After AlphaGo defeated a professional Go player in 2015, artificial intelligence once again attracted widespread global attention.[18] For most of its history, AI research has been divided into sub-fields that often fail to communicate with each other.
     These sub-fields are based on technical considerations, such as particular goals (e.g. "robotics" or "machine learning"), 
     the use of particular tools ("logic" or artificial neural networks), or deep philosophical differences. 
     Sub-fields have also been based on social factors (particular institutions or the work of particular researchers)</big></p>
