                    <p><big>Artificial intelligence (AI) has gradually been making its way into business software and will continue to for the foreseeable future. 
                        These intelligent applications have incorporated machine and deep learning algorithms into their everyday functionality to better automate tasks for the user. 
                        Automating these processes saves the user time and energy, makes their job simpler, and allows employees to work more efficiently and productively. 
                        While there are some that believe AI is out to replace their jobs, they will be pleasantly surprised that, in most cases, this is a false assumption. 
                        Instead, the application of AI will simply make their jobs easier. For the developers interested in building their own intelligent applications, the AI platforms, machine learning algorithms, and deep learning libraries and frameworks used to create such functionality are found in the following subcategories:
                        Who Uses Artificial Intelligence Software?
                        While many employees probably interact with intelligent applications, the users of AI software are primarily software engineers who use the tools to build those intelligent applications. 
                        It takes a high knowledge of machine learning and software development to fully utilize AI software. There is a significant gap in the need for machine learning developers and the number of qualified candidates. 
                        Many larger companies offer high wages to those who can build machine learning algorithms or have the knowledge to train deep learning models. Despite the demand and lucrative salaries, there is still a general shortage of those who can take advantage of AI software.
                        Similarly, there is a shortage in data scientists, another position that may use AI software. 
                        Data scientists are not necessarily developing intelligent applications, but instead using machine learning models to extract actionable insights from data. Most frequently, these employees would take advantage of predictive analytics or natural language processing, among other AI software features, to pull valuable business insights from company data.
